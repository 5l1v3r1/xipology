# Xipology

A covert channel using nothing but DNS cache.

# Blog texts

This is our story of exploiting caching Domain Name System (DNS) servers to break network segregation. Weâ€™ll call it Xipology and introduce it to you in three parts. First we will go through a bit of background and theory, then introduce a library to build on, and finally show you an application for a peer discovery over DNS.

Enjoy :)
